## 🌌 Favorite Quote
> _"The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff." — Carl Sagan_
*"Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water.  
> If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.  
> You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.  
> You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.  
> Now, water can flow or it can crash.  
> **Be water, my friend.**"*
